# API & CLI Access

Use tokens to automate WatchAPI from CI or your local machine.

## API Tokens

- Create tokens in Profile → API Tokens.
- Tokens start with `wai_` and can be revoked at any time.
- Keep tokens secret; rotate if you suspect exposure.

## CLI

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @watchapi/cli
```

Authenticate by exporting your token:

```bash
export WATCHAPI_TOKEN=wai_your_token_here
```

### Common Commands

- Sync tRPC routes:

  ```bash
  watchapi sync --domain https://api.example.com --prefix api/trpc
  ```

- Sync OpenAPI definitions:

  ```bash
  watchapi sync --domain https://api.example.com --openapi /openapi.json
  ```

CLI help is also available via `watchapi --help`.

## Rate Limits

- API calls include lightweight rate limiting tied to your plan.
- If you hit limits, wait briefly or upgrade your plan to raise the ceiling.
