# Getting Started

Spin up your WatchAPI workspace and start monitoring.

## Create Your Workspace

1. Sign up at `/signup`.
2. Invite teammates from Settings → Members.
3. Generate an API token in Profile → API Tokens (prefix `wai_`) for CLI or
   automation.

## Add Your First Endpoint

1. Go to Collections → Endpoints.
2. Click **New Endpoint** and enter:
   - URL and HTTP method
   - Expected interval (defaults to 1 minute)
   - Optional: headers, body, success status range
3. Save. WatchAPI schedules health checks automatically.

## Set Up Alerts

1. Open Alerts → Notification Channels and add webhook, Slack, or
   Discord.
2. Create an alert rule for the endpoint:
   - Trigger on failures or latency above a threshold
   - Pick one or more channels
3. Alerts are throttled to prevent noise; review history in Alerts → Activity.

## View Results

- Dashboard: current uptime, response times, and recent failures.
- Endpoint detail: per-check history with status and latency.
- Collections: rollups by service or environment.

## Use The CLI (optional)

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @watchapi/cli
```

Login to your account:

```bash
watchapi login --api-token wai_your_token_here
```

Sync your APIs:

```bash
watchapi sync --domain https://api.example.com --prefix api/trpc
```

CLI commands appear in the in-app reference under Help → CLI. After syncing,
your definitions show up in the dashboard alongside manually added checks.
