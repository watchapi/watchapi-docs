## Requirements

Before importing endpoints, make sure your project meets the following:

- **Visual Studio Code** `v1.90.0` or newer
- A **TypeScript-based project**
- One of the supported API patterns:

  - Next.js route handlers
  - tRPC routers

No additional configuration is required for basic usage.

---

## Permissions & Safety

WatchAPI Client runs entirely **inside your editor**.

- It reads your local source files
- It does not modify your code
- It does not overwrite existing requests
- No endpoints or payloads are sent externally by default

Imports are non-destructive and safe to re-run.

1. Open a supported project
2. Open the Command Palette
   (`Cmd + Shift + P` / `Ctrl + Shift + P`)
3. Run **WatchAPI: Import from Code**

If the command appears, the extension is installed correctly.
