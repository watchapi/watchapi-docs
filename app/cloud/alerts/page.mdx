# Alerts

Stay ahead of incidents with flexible notification channels and rules.

## Channels

- Webhook — POST JSON to your systems.
- Slack — deliver to a channel via incoming webhook.
- Discord — notify a server channel.
- Email (Coming soon) — send to one or many recipients.

Add channels in Alerts → Notification Channels. You can attach multiple channels
to the same rule.

## Rules

1. Choose the endpoint or collection to watch.
2. Select the trigger:
   - Consecutive failures
   - Latency above a threshold
3. Pick one or more channels and save.

## Noise Control

- Built-in throttling prevents duplicate alerts during prolonged outages.
- Alerts show up in Alerts → Activity so you can review what fired and why.

## Best Practices

- Send critical services to both Slack/Discord and email.
- Use higher latency thresholds for batch endpoints; keep tighter thresholds for
  synchronous APIs.
- Pair alerts with distinct channels per environment (e.g., staging vs.
  production).
