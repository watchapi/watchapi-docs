# Overview

WatchAPI is an API monitoring platform for engineering teams. Schedule health
checks, track uptime and latency, and alert the right channels when something
breaks—all in a few clicks.

## What You Get

- **Always-on monitoring:** HTTP checks on your endpoints with status, latency,
  and failure history.
- **Uptime dashboards:** See which services are up, down, or flapping with
  recent trends.
- **Alerting:** Email, webhook, Slack, and Discord notifications with sensible
  throttling to avoid alert storms.
- **Collections and teams:** Organize endpoints by product or environment;
  invite teammates to share ownership.
- **CLI + sync:** Push your tRPC/OpenAPI endpoints from code so checks stay in
  lockstep with your schemas.
