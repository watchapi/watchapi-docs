# Welcome to WatchAPI Client

**WatchAPI Client** is a VS Code–native API client that **imports API endpoints from your codebase** and turns them into structured, executable collections.

It reads your actual source code — not OpenAPI files — so the requests you work with always reflect how your API is really defined.

---

## What WatchAPI Client Does

WatchAPI Client helps you:

- Import REST endpoints directly from your code
- Import tRPC procedures from routers
- Organize endpoints into readable collections
- Execute requests without leaving VS Code
- Keep manual edits intact between imports

Each import only **adds new endpoints**.
Existing requests are never modified or removed.

---

## Designed for Code-First APIs

WatchAPI Client is built for modern TypeScript projects where **code is the source of truth**.

By importing endpoints directly from handlers and routers, it avoids duplicated definitions and reduces drift between code and testing tools.

---

## Supported Technologies

WatchAPI Client currently supports:

- **Next.js** app and pages route handlers
- **NestJS**
- **tRPC**

Support expands carefully to maintain correctness.
