# Monitoring

WatchAPI runs HTTP checks at a fixed interval, records every result, and surfaces uptime and latency trends.

## How Checks Run

- Default interval: 1 minute. You can raise it per endpoint to reduce load.
- Execution: standard HTTP requests with optional headers/body you provide.
- Success rules: 2xx by default; customize status ranges per endpoint.
- Retry: a single fast retry is attempted before marking a failure.

## What We Store

- Status code and response time for each check.
- Failure reason (timeout, DNS, network, or non-success status).
- Timestamps for charting uptime and latency.

## Dashboards

- **Overview:** current up/down state and recent incidents.
- **Endpoint detail:** full check history with status/latency charts.
- **Collections:** grouped rollups by product or environment.

## Tuning Tips

- Use shorter intervals for critical health checks; increase for low-traffic
  services to avoid noise.
- Add auth headers or request bodies when your endpoint requires them.
- Pair checks with alert rules so incidents reach the right channel quickly.
